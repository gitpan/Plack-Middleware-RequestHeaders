=head1 NAME

Config::MVP::Reader::Hash - a reader that tries to cope with a plain old hashref

=head1 VERSION

version 2.200002

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $sequence = Config::MVP::Reader::Hash->new->read_config( \%config );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

In some ways, this is the L<Config::MVP::Reader> of last resort.  Given a
hashref, it attempts to interpret it as a Config::MVP::Sequence.  Because
hashes are generally unordered, order can't be relied upon unless the hash tied
to have order (presumably with L<Tie::IxHash>).  The hash keys are assumed to
be section names and will be used as the section package moniker unless a
L<__package> entry is found.
