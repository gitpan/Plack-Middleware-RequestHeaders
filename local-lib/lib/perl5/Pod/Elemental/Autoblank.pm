=head1 NAME

Pod::Elemental::Autoblank - a paragraph that always displays an extra blank line in Pod form

=head1 VERSION

version 0.102362

=head1 OVERVIEW

This role exists primarily to simplify elements produced by the Pod5
transformer.  Any element with this role composed into it will append an extra
newline to the normally generated response to the C<as_pod_string> method.

That's it!
