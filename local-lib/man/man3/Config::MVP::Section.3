.IX Title "Config::MVP::Section 3"
.TH Config::MVP::Section 3 "2012-03-16" "perl v5.10.1" "User Contributed Perl Documentation"
.\" For nroff, turn off justification.  Always turn off hyphenation; it makes
.\" way too many mistakes in technical documents.
.if n .ad l
.nh
.SH "NAME"
Config::MVP::Section \- one section of an MVP configuration sequence
.SH "VERSION"
.IX Header "VERSION"
version 2.200002
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
For the most part, you can just consult Config::MVP to understand what this
class is and how it's used.
.SH "ATTRIBUTES"
.IX Header "ATTRIBUTES"
.SS "name"
.IX Subsection "name"
This is the section's name.  It's a string, and it must be provided.
.SS "package"
.IX Subsection "package"
This is the (Perl) package with which the section is associated.  It is
optional.  When the section is instantiated, it will ensure that this package
is loaded.
.SS "multivalue_args"
.IX Subsection "multivalue_args"
This attribute is an arrayref of value names that should be considered
multivalue properties in the section.  When added to the section, they will
always be wrapped in an arrayref, and they may be added to the section more
than once.
.PP
If this attribute is not given during construction, it will default to the
result of calling section's package's \f(CW\*(C`mvp_multivalue_args\*(C'\fR method.  If the
section has no associated package or if the package doesn't provide that
method, it default to an empty arrayref.
.SS "aliases"
.IX Subsection "aliases"
This attribute is a hashref of name remappings.  For example, if it contains
this hashref:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  {
\&    file => \*(Aqfiles\*(Aq,
\&    path => \*(Aqfiles\*(Aq,
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
Then attempting to set either the \*(L"file\*(R" or \*(L"path\*(R" setting for the section
would actually set the \*(L"files\*(R" setting.
.PP
If this attribute is not given during construction, it will default to the
result of calling section's package's \f(CW\*(C`mvp_aliases\*(C'\fR method.  If the
section has no associated package or if the package doesn't provide that
method, it default to an empty hashref.
.SS "payload"
.IX Subsection "payload"
This is the storage into which properties are set.  It is a hashref of names
and values.  You should probably not alter the contents of the payload, and
should read its contents only.
.SS "is_finalized"
.IX Subsection "is_finalized"
This attribute is true if the section has been marked finalized, which will
prevent any new values from being added to it.  It can be set with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`finalize\*(C'\fR method.
.SS "sequence"
.IX Subsection "sequence"
This attributes points to the sequence into which the section has been
assembled.  It may be unset if the section has been created but not yet placed
in a sequence.
.SH "METHODS"
.IX Header "METHODS"
.SS "add_value"
.IX Subsection "add_value"
.Vb 1
\&  $section\->add_value( $name => $value );
.Ve
.PP
This method sets the value for the named property to the given value.  If the
property is a multivalue property, the new value will be pushed onto the end of
an arrayref that will store all values for that property.
.PP
Attempting to add a value for a non-multivalue property whose value was already
added will result in an exception.
.SS "load_package"
.IX Subsection "load_package"
.Vb 1
\&  $section\->load_package($package, $plugin);
.Ve
.PP
This method is used to ensure that the given \f(CW$package\fR is loaded, and is
called whenever a section with a package is created.  By default, it delegates
to Class::Load.  If the package can't be found, it calls the
missing_package method.  Errors in compilation are not suppressed.
.SS "missing_package"
.IX Subsection "missing_package"
.Vb 1
\&  $section\->missing_package($package, $plugin);
.Ve
.PP
This method is called when \f(CW\*(C`load_package\*(C'\fR encounters a package that is not
installed.  By default, it throws an exception.
